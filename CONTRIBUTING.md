# Contributing to Typerio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Typerio. It's people like you that make Typerio such a great tool.

## Getting started

To start contributing, you need to clone the repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```console
git clone https://github.com/pasiastazebra/typerio.git
```

Once you have a local copy of the project, you can create a new branch to work on. To do this, you can use the following command:

```console
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```


Replace `your-branch-name` with a name that is descriptive of the changes you plan to make.

## Code changes

When making changes, please follow these guidelines:

- Use standard JavaScript naming practices such as camelCase.
- Try to use functions and avoid mutability (prefer `const` over `let`).
- The code should be self-documenting, but comments are also welcome.
- Prettier is required with the default configuration.
- For CSS classes, the plugin prefixes all internal classes with "typerio-", e.g., "typerio-black".
